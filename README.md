A React Native module for saving asset-library:// paths to the documents folder

## Getting started

1. `npm install react-native-save-asset-library --save`
2. In XCode, in the project navigator, right click `your project` ➜ `Add Files to [your project's name]`
3. Go to `node_modules` ➜ `react-native-save-asset-library` and add `SaveAssetLibrary.m`
4. Run your project (`Cmd+R`)

## Usage

```javascript
var SaveAssetLibrary = require('react-native-save-asset-library');

var obj = {
    imagePath: "asset-library://", // (required) Path to asset-library:// for example from CameraRoll
    imageName: "imageName", // (required) This is what you want the image to be named
    imageType: "jpg", // (optional) "png" or "jpg".  Default it jpg.  More image types could be supported send me a pull request
    width: 2048, // (optional) Size of the image to be saved. Default is 2048
    height: 2048, // (optional) Size of the image to be saved. Default is 2048
};
var successCallBack = (imagePath)=>{
    // image has been saved.
    console.log('Path: ' + imagePath);
};
var errorCallback = (error)=>{
    console.log('error: ', error);
};
SaveAssetLibrary.SaveImage(obj, successCallack, errorCallback);
```
## Road Map, Feature Requests & Bug Fixes

I will add to this module as I need more features and I hope you will too, pull requests are always welcome.  I will not add features on request because I'm busy with other projects.  I want this to be a community written module so if there is a feature that's missing or bug, add it or fix it and send me a pull request.  If you don't know Objective C you can learn it.  We all were where you are now at some point.  [StackOverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/) is your friend.  :)

### Features that could be added:

* Support for other folders.  RIght now it only saves files to the `Documents` folder
* Support more image types
* Better image size support.  It would be nice if you would just get the largest possible image
* Support for PHImageContentModeAspectFill, it currently defaults to (PHImageContentModeAspectFit)[https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Photos/Reference/PHImageManager_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/c/econst/PHImageContentModeAspectFit]
